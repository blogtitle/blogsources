# Disclaimer
This is a rant. It means that it might contain poor word choice (worse than usual), strong language, meaningless ramblings. I don't proofread rants to give them the **raw** rageful experience to the reader.

Enjoy.

# Video Cables Format
I used to have the best laptop, and the best docking station. It was a proprietary docking station THAT WORKED. It had several video plugs available, which allowed me to just buy a couple of cables for my screens, and I was done with it.
