# Preface
---------

What follows wants to be a tip to the reader, not a technical one, but a survival one.

My career kicked off pretty fast, and in an unexpected way. A good dose of sheer luck and some skills got me where I am now, and I'm grateful for what I accomplished and I'm happy with what I got.

# But
-----

But while I was working towards getting where I wanted to be, I committed some mistakes, and I'm sharing them with you today. I'm sharing to maybe help you avoid committing them yourself, or help you recognize that you are doing the same, and stop while you are in time.

These, at least, are the reasons I tell myself, but the real one is that I need to get this off my chest.

# What happened
---------------
During my 4th year of university, right after getting my bachelor's degree in computer science engineering, I met a person that changed my life.

He was teaching Computer Security at Politecnico di Milano, and he was able to really talk to me. I don't know if you've ever met that one teacher, that one professor who is able to speak to you and make every notion, every concept, click into place and fit in the right spot of your mind, but if you did, that was him.

He made me love computer security more than I even already did. After his lessons, I would always stop for questions and sometimes even ask them during the lecture (probably annoying everyone in the room, sorry about that). He introduced me to the Capture-The-Flag team that played in Politecnico di Milano, "Tower of Hanoi". There I learned to love CS even more. I learned how to write advanced exploits, ROP chains and even got to the point to write a format string vulnerability c compiler.

That was when I realized I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. I've always wanted to work on a hard job, on complex, almost unfathomable stuff, to keep my mind busy inventing solution, and that was the answer I had been waiting for a very long time.

I liked my team so much I started creating binary exploitation lessons for newcomers and advanced ones for experienced teammates.

It was after six months of playing CTFs and enjoying being a student for the first time in my life that I was presented a choice: my CS professor wrote on a social network that his company was hiring. It was a penetration testing consulting company based in Milan, where I could do security and coding most of my days, and where I could probably forget about studying stuff I couldn't care less about.

The choice was fairly easy on my side, but I still needed a little push by [Anna](TODO) to find the courage to apply for the position.

I got hired, and while I was reading my contract, a teammate of mine, who had a very bad work experience in the past and went back to studying, told me:

> Are you ready to sign your TODO rinuncia of studying?

I honestly was, but I underestimated the other costs of what I was about to do.

My professor, friend, and soon-to-be boss, gave me a chance to enter the computer security professional field, and I was ready to take it.

# What started to go wrong
--------------------------

Consulting is a bitch, but I did not know it. The company I was going to work for is probably one of the kindest company you can possibly work for if you are a consultant, but this doesn't make being a consultant anyway easy.

If you are consulting you are pushed into an impossible situation most of the time, you spend 80% of your time doing what you like, 20% of your time doing useless stuff that your client requires and 20% of your time writing the report.

This takes away a chunk of your free time, and a part of you.

I underestimated the cost of that at first, and kept going. I explored a chunk of the world while working, I learned web security on the job and did everything I could to be the best that I could be.

I even wrote my own https proxy to use when Burp Suite (the de-facto standard for web penetration testing) failed. I agreed to be shipped everywhere with laughable notice because the client could not sort their shit in a humane manner.

And that is where I started to be horribly wrong.

To meet the consultancy field demands, I stopped playing CTFs. Soon after that I stopped seeing some of my friends. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time, and I feel horrible to write this.

I had a job I liked, and I wanted to invest my energies in that, I wanted to build a career, and maybe, one day, get to be the person who made the calls in my company, and shape it like I would have liked it to be.

Problem is: I wanted more. Consulting was getting annoying in some parts and midblowingly boring in some others (I hate writing reports and automation was not an option). As I said above: I like hard problems, and completely owning some banks PHP4+Perl based accounting software was not entertaining any more.

So I started doing independent research. I was able to speak at BlackHat Asia and some other security conferences, by investing what little was left of my free time in research.

# What went horribly wrong
--------------------------

At this point I was doing very good at what I did, I got a promotion, got a raise, so I could afford a house in the city, and I got it. I went to live there with my at the time girlfriend who was still studying.

Problem was, I didn't have any free time. I would get home exhausted, completely drained from my energy, and still wanted to do something useful, like research, but I couldn't. So out of frustration and lack of brain energy I just played or watched some movies. Needless to say: this took a toll on my relationship. This also took a toll on my friendships. My teammates didn't even expect me to show up for a CTF and stopped asking. I also stopped working on the https proxy I was working on with Anna. I was just a failure to all the people I held dearest, and kept failing them over and over again, corroding the trust that is at the foundation of every relation.

I stopped hearing from my teammates, I stopped working with Anna on our project, I could not make it to see my friends, and my girlfriend was just exhausted from the studying and would just be completely overwhelmed by the weight I was carrying when she got home every day.

This situation went on for a long time. My closest friends were all spread across the world, and the geographically closest one couldn't get to see me because I was always busy.

I destroyed was what between me and the person I lived with. I hammered on my friendships, I consumed everyone close to me, even my parents saw me turning in an always-stressed monster.

This caused me to have a nervous breakdown, and fall in depression. I found myself in a situation where I couldn't see a way out, and I just kept falling down.

# The saving
------------

It was at this exact moment when I friend of mine, one of the few that were still close enough to see what I had become, an ex-teammate and a fellow hacker, decided to refer me for a job at Google.

He was doing an internship at the time and getting a referral from an intern felt odd, but I decided to take that chance.

With what was left of my strength I decided to grab that rope and try to lift myself out. I prepared for the interview, and I passed it.

I resigned from the previous company and got a couple of months off to get things sorted before beginning the new job. It was then that I really looked around for the first time, and saw the wasteland I caused.

I damaged everyone I cared about. I put them in front of the decision between staying close to me and not being hurt.

It was shortly after I started the new job that my relation fell apart, not just for the reasons above, but what I had done in the previous months was there to make everything worse.

Most of my friends were just too far to reasonably talk to them. I was left with a couple of people that were still close enough to help me recover.

# The aftermath
---------------

It's been 9 moths now, and I almost completely recovered. PTSD has almost completely washed away, depression is on the verge of being out of my life again, and I have a couple of friends and a partner

Sometimes relationships eing hard and ending is not the problem is the synthomps

so please, don't do as I did, don't ignore the people closest to you, dont get to the point where you need to create a list of people who you need to apologize for.
