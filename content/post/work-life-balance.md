# Preface
---------

What follows wants to be a tip to the reader, not a technical one as usual, but a survival one.

My career kicked off pretty fast, in an unexpected way. A good dose of sheer luck and some skills got me where I am now, and I'm grateful for what I accomplished and I'm happy with what I got.

# But
-----

But while I was working towards getting where I wanted to be, I committed some mistakes, and I'm sharing them with you today. I'm sharing to maybe help you avoid committing them yourself, or help you recognize that you are doing the same, and hint you to stop while you can.

These, at least, are the reasons I tell myself but the real one is that I need to get this off my chest.

# What happened
---------------
During my 4th year of university, right after getting my bachelor's degree in computer science engineering, I met a person that changed my life.

He was teaching Computer Security at Politecnico di Milano, and he was able to **really** talk to me. I don't know if you've ever met that one teacher, that one professor who is able to speak to you and make every notion, every concept, click into place and fit in the right spot of your mind, but if you did, that was him for me.

He made me love computer security even more than I already did. After his lessons, I would always stop for questions and sometimes even ask them during the lecture (probably annoying everyone in the room, sorry about that). He introduced me to the Capture-The-Flag team that played in Politecnico di Milano, "Tower of Hanoi". There I learned to love computer security even more. I learned how to write advanced exploits, ROP chains and even got to the point to write a format string vulnerability c compiler.

That was when I realized I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. I've always wanted to work on a hard, complex job. I wanted to deal with almost unfathomable stuff and keep my mind busy inventing solution. That was the answer I had been waiting for for a very long time.

I liked my CTF team so much I started creating binary exploitation lessons for newcomers and advanced ones for experienced teammates.

It was after six months of playing CTFs and enjoying being a student for the first time in my life that I was presented a choice: my aforementioned professor wrote on a social network that his company was hiring. It is a penetration testing consulting company based in Milan, where I could do security and coding most of my days and where I could probably forget about studying stuff I couldn't care less about.

The choice was fairly easy on my side, but I still needed a little push by [Anna](TODO) to find the courage to apply for the position.

I got hired, and while I was reading my contract, a teammate of mine, who had a very bad work experience in the past and went back to studying, told me:

> Are you ready to sign your TODO rinuncia of studying?

I honestly was, but I underestimated the other costs of what I was about to do.

My professor, friend, and soon-to-be boss, gave me a chance to enter the computer security professional field, and I was ready to take it.

# What started to go wrong
--------------------------

Consulting is a bitch, but I did not know it. The company I was going to work for is probably one of the kindest company you can possibly work for if you are a consultant, but this doesn't make being a consultant in any way easy.

If you are consulting you are pushed into an impossible situation most of the time, you spend 80% of your time doing what you like, 20% of your time doing useless stuff that your client requires and 20% of your time writing the report.

This takes away a chunk of your free time, and a part of you.

I underestimated the cost of that at first, and kept going. I explored a some interesting parts of the world while working, I learned web security on the job and did everything I could to be the best that I could be.

I even wrote my own https proxy to use when Burp Suite (the de-facto standard for web penetration testing) failed. I agreed to be shipped everywhere with laughable notice because the client could not sort their shit in a humane manner.

And that is where I started to be horribly wrong.

To meet the consultancy field demands, I stopped playing CTFs. Soon after that I stopped seeing some of my friends. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time, and I feel horrible to write this.

I had a job I liked, and I wanted to invest my energies in that, I wanted to build a career and maybe get to be the person who made the calls in my company, shape it like I would have liked it to be. I wanted to make my coworkers happy and build a nice environment.

Problem is: I wanted more. Consulting was getting annoying in some parts and midblowingly boring in some others (I hate writing reports and automation was not an option for many reasons). As I said above: I like hard problems and finding tens of critical vulnerabilities in some PHP4+Perl accounting software was not entertaining anymore.

That's when I started doing independent research. I was able to speak at BlackHat Asia and some other security conferences. To do so I had to invest what little was left of my free time in research.

# What went horribly wrong
--------------------------

At this point I was becoming very good at what I did, I got a promotion, got a good raise. I could then afford a house in the city, and I got it. I went to live there with my at the time girlfriend who was still studying.

What I failed to consider is that I didn't have any free time left. I was using calendar slots for almost everything. Most days I would get home exhausted, completely drained from my energy, and still wanted to do something useful, like research, but I couldn't. Out of frustration and lack of brain energy I just played or watched some movies.
Needless to say: this took a toll on my relationship. This also took a toll on my friendships. My teammates didn't even expect me to show up for a CTF and stopped asking. I also stopped working on the https proxy I was working on with Anna. I was just a failure to all the people I held dearest, and kept failing them over and over again, corroding the trust that is at the foundation of every relation.

I stopped hearing from my teammates, I stopped working with Anna on our project, I could not make it to see my friends. On top of that my girlfriend was often exhausted from the studying and I was too overwhelmed by the weight I was carrying to find the strength to help her with that.

This situation went on for a long time. My closest friends were all spread across the world, and the geographically closest one couldn't get to see me because I was always busy.

I destroyed was what between me and the person I lived with. I hammered on my friendships, I consumed everyone close to me, even my parents saw me turning in an always-stressed being.

This caused me to have a nervous breakdown and fall in depression. I found myself in a situation where I couldn't see a way out, and I just kept falling down. Things just got darker and darker.

# The saving
------------

It was in that exact moment when a friend of mine, one of the few that were still close enough to see what I had become, an ex-teammate and a fellow hacker, decided to refer me for a job at Google.

He was doing an internship at the time and getting a referral from an intern felt odd, but I decided to take that chance.

With what was left of my strength I decided to grab that rope and try to lift myself out. I prepared for the interview, and I passed it.

I resigned from the previous company and got a couple of months off to get things sorted before beginning the new job.

It was then that I really looked around for the first time, and saw the wasteland I caused.

I damaged everyone I cared about. I put them in front of the decision between staying close to me and not being hurt.

It was shortly after I started the new job that my relationship with my partner fell apart, not just for the reasons above, but what I had done in the previous months was there to make everything worse.

Most of my friends were just too far to reasonably talk to them. I felt bad even for asking them to meet again.

I was left with a couple of people that were still close enough to help me recover.

# The aftermath
---------------

It's been a year now, and I almost completely recovered. The side effects of that dark period of my life have almost completely washed away and I have a handful of friends and a partner.

Sometimes human relationships being hard and ending is not the problem, it is just the symptom that something is not right. Sometimes if you need to look at your calendar or think about work-related things when you have to decide whether or not going out with your friends, you might not be in an healthy place. Sometimes if you need to put in extra working hours to be satisfied with your life you should consider changing what you do.

If you can get one thing away from this: please, don't do as I did, don't ignore the people closest to you, don't get to the point where you need to create a list of people who you need to apologize for. Don't put yourself in a place where you can't get out, and if you find yourself in one, put all your energies in fixing the situation.

Jobs come and go, friends don't.

I'd like to conclude by saying that I'm sorry.

In alphabetical order:

Alessandro, non avrei voluto che ci sentissimo solo tramite un microfono, e solo per giocare.

Alex, Noemi, Nick e tutti i miei colleghi cui avrei voluto spiegare più cose prima di andarmene, mi spiace.

Anna, mi spiace di non esserci stato come avrei voluto per aiutarti con le difficoltà del trasloco e del nuovo lavoro. Mi spiace di aver abbandonato i nostri progetti.

Erica, mi sarebbe piaciuto riuscire a vederci di più ed esserci quando ti sei trovata ad affrontare quei momenti difficili di cui abbiamo solo potuto brevemente parlare.

Giacomo, ci sarei voluto essere di più per te e avrei tanto voluto coltivare la nostra amicizia.

Giovanni, mi spiace di non averti visto o sentito per mesi quando sarebbe bastato un attimo per essere da te.

Ilaria, mi spiace di averti trattato come non meritavi, e di non esserti stato di minimo aiuto per i problemi con l'università. Mi spiace di averti richiesto sforzi di venirmi in contro quando già le tue energie erano poche.

Laura, mi spiace di aver fatto fatica a sostenerti quando avevi bisogno di me.

Mamma e Papà, quante volte vi ho risposto in modo nervoso e non avrei dovuto. Mi spiace.

Mirko e Cecilia, non ci siamo praticamente più visti o sentiti, e questo mi fa male ogni volta che ci penso.

Stefano, mi spiace per come sia andata tra noi. Mi spiace per tutti i litigi e per tutte le occasioni che non ho visto per poterci riconciliare o magari affrontare meglio ciò che ci stava allontanando.

Thomas, I'm sorry we had to meet in such a situation and you got to see just my darkest, unfriendly part.

To everyone that I failed when they needed me and to everyone that just wanted to spend some quality time with me and I wasn't there, I'm sorry.

For what little it is worth, I think I got the lesson now.
