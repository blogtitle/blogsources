# Disclaimer
This is a non-technical post. This is a post on burnout. This is a post to help you not make my same mistake.

As some of you might have noticed, in recent times I stopped proactively working on the blog. This is a post on the reason behind it and an explanation on why I will likely not resume working on the blog soon (especially for complicated topics like security).

# Background
About 2 years ago I was going through a burnout: I stopped coding in my free time (after 12 years), I stopped feeling like doing anything, I lost touch with my own emotions. The burnout was not only work related, it was also about my personal relationships (as it is often the case).

Six months later I almost completely changed life and it took me a little over nine more months to recover and get back on track, or so I thought.

I restarted feeling well but I did not notice the scars and the weak spots that that horrible experience left on me. I overestimated my skill to recover, especially considering I recovered **completely alone**. I worked my own way out of the dark place I found myself in, and that was probably another mistake.
