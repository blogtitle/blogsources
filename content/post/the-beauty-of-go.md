# Preface

I went through Pascal, VB.Net, C#, C, Java and Python before meeting Go.

I then explored JS and TS, with a little bit of Rust.

If you would like to have some more context on what brought me to Go, please read it [here](https://blogtitle.github.io/robs-personal-history-of-programming-languages/). 

If you'd like to know why I still use Go, continue reading.

# Readability
* No need for much context to understand code
* All idiomatic Go code is readable in the same way
* No macros, metaprogramming, elaborated constructs, override, overload
* Two accessibility levels
* Tests are just programs

# Writability
* Little to almost 0 noise
* Easy, not much you need to know
* Compiler returns clear error messages
* Write code, not types or meta-types or annotations
* Composition + Promotion
* Interfaces
* Garbage collected

# Multithreading
* select
* go
* chan
* sync package
* Garbage collected

# Reliability
* Rare crashes
* Almost no compiler bugs
* No surprises

# Performance
* Fast to run
* Fast to compile
* Very fast to do parallel stuff

# Type system
* Strong
* Static, but can be dynamic if needed
* Ducktyping
* No magic

# Standard library
* huge
* powerful
* well documented, with examples

# Toolchain
* get
* doc
* fmt
* vet
* build (cross platform)
* test (+ cover and race)
* trace
* pprof
* present

# Ecosystem
* Confs
* Community
* Protobufs
* Many libraries
* go tour
