# The blog
This blog is about everything that the authors want to talk about!

# The authors

## [Anna] (https://blogtitle.github.io/authors/anna/)
Anna is a traveler, yogi, scuba diver and many other things. Between her adventures she enjoys writing Go code, currently developing [Wapty](https://github.com/empijei/wapty). She is now based in San Francisco working with Stripe's security team.

Opinions are her own.

## [Rob](https://blogtitle.github.io/authors/rob/)
Rob is a coder, science lover and glitch magnet. He likes to find weird and unexpected behaviors in anything related to technology. You can find some of his opinions [on twitter](https://twitter.com/empijei) and some of his code [on GitHub](https://github.com/empijei).
He currently works as a security engineer @Google.

Opinions are his very own unless hacked. In that case they are hacker's.

# Licences, technologies, credits
The blog is built using the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The theme is [clorine](https://github.com/AnnaOpss/hugo-chlorine-theme): a fork of the [natrium](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-natrium-theme/) theme, changed by Anna to support multiple authors and slightly adjusted by Rob for colors and fonts.

The font used to render code blocks is the awesome [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
